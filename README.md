# DataCleaning
Simple DA cleaning project

Dataset was given by our lecturer and it was a group project to clean and remove dirty data. The dataset was a logistic company's shipment data on a quarterly basis and data was forcibly moved around, wrongly written valueas for different columns. Simple data analysis, create insights, decision-making advice and a short dashboarding exercise.
